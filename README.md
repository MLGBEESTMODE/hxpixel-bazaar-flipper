press on the green button code and click download zip

if you know python you can just do what you want with it
but if you dont just use the exe file
or you can learn how to code by following a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=3913s (not that hard)

setting up your setting has to be done manualy every time you start the program up

setting explenation: After setting list lenght and refresh time you can change settings
press 0 to end the program, and to sort the list press 1 by potential profit, 2 name, 3 margin, 4 sell price, 5 buy price
6 volume, 7 by competitivness and 8 for P/C, also type 1 after the first number too sort backward and 1 too sort forward

explenation is in the program


Explenation of all values:
1

the first number on the right is the amount of money the program thinks you could make by 
looking ate the average amount of times the item has ben sold or bought in the last week
and divides that per hour and multiplies that by the current price for selling

2
second is the api name of the item, thats why it looks weird

3
margin is the price where you can sell an item for divided by the price you can buy an item for minus a 0.01125% tax
wich is the lowest tax you can get without getting mvp or somth

4
sell price

5
buy price

6 volume is the average amount of times the item has ben sold or bought, it will take whatever number was lower, and divided to an hourly basis


7
competetivness is the amount of times the top sell and the top buy orders change, so how competitive the market for that item is
this metric is partly flawed becuse the api gets only refreshed every 0.6sec and players are hella fast, so its recommended to wait 
atleast 20mins to be able to trust that metric, and even still it might still be misleading like for very competitive items like booster cookies

8
P/C is the potential profit divided by competitivness, this metric is theroticly the best metric to decide what items to pick
for flipping

Extra information:

total daily profit


5% of hourly profit estimate for currently showed items, is to give a relativly conservativ estamite on how much money you could make
if you dident have any limit on how much money you have for flipping


estimated value of all market transaction, is just a gimmic 


and the amount of times it runs for


also you can press enter to close the program, wich is for people who run the program in there console

btw i dont think this program could help people ate making money when flipping, i dont know what to tell ya
